## Problem Overview

Our project focuses on using the **Chicago crime dataset** to predict and analyze crime patterns across the city. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to identify trends, forecast future crimes, and suggest actionable strategies that can help law enforcement and policymakers prevent crimes proactively.   
Our problem is: **How can we use historical crime data to predict future crime trends and take proactive measures to reduce crime, and improve public safety in the city?**   

We aim to use historical crime data combined with temporal, spatial, and contextual features to build predictive models. These models will help us forecast future crime trends, allowing for preemptive measures such as optimizing police deployment, issuing public safety alerts, and guiding policymaking to improve resource allocation and overall public safety.

## Datasets  

We will use the following datasets:

**Chicago crime data:** [https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2)   
(We will be using data from 2001 to 18/10/2024: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wazTYkb5iBLT7WvqrSyBO0klhIQyx8uu/view?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wazTYkb5iBLT7WvqrSyBO0klhIQyx8uu/view?usp=drive_link))
